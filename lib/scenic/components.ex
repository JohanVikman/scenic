  ## About Components

  Components are small scenes that are referenced, and managed, by another scene.
  They are useful for reusing bits of UI and containing the logic that runs them.

  ## Helper Functions

  This module contains a set of helper functions to make it easy to add, or modify,
  the standard components in a graph.

  In general, each helper function is of the form
      def name_of_component( graph, data, options \\\\ [] )

  Unlike primitives, components are scenes in themselves. Each component
  is is run by a GenServer and adding a basic component does two things.

    1) A new component GenServer is started and supervised by the owning
    scene's dynamic scene supervisor.
    2) A reference to the new scene is added to the graph.

  This doesn't happen all at once. These helper functions simply add
  a reference to a to-be-started component to your graph. When you call
  `push_graph/1` to the ViewPort then manages the lifecycle of the components.

  You can also supervise components yourself, but then you should add
  the scene reference yourself via the `scene_ref/3` function, which is in the
  [`Scenic.Primitives`](Scenic.Primitives.html) module.

  When adding components to a graph, each helper function accepts a
  graph as the first parameter and returns the transformed graph. This
  makes is very easy to buid a complex graph by piping helper functions
  together.

      @graph Graph.build()
      |> button( "Press Me", id: :sample_button )

  When modifying a graph, you can again use the helpers by passing
  in the component to be modified. The transformed component will
  be returned.

      Graph.modify(graph, :sample_button, fn(p) ->
        button( p, "Continue" )
      end)

      # or, more compactly...

      Graph.modify(graph, :sample_button, &button(&1, "Continue") )

  In each case, the second parameter is a data term that is specific
  to the component being acted on. See the documentation below. If you
  pass in invalid data for the second parameter an error will be 
  thrown along with some explanation of what it expected.

  The third parameter is a keyword list of options that are to be
  applied to the component. This includes setting the id, styles,
  transforms and such.

      @graph Graph.build()
      |> button( "Press Me", id: :sample_button, rotate: 0.4)


  ### Event messages

  Most basic or input components exist to collect data and/or send
  messages to the host scene that references.

  For example, when a button scene decides that it has been "clicked",
  the generic button component doesn't know how to do anything with that
  information. So it sends a `{:click, id}` to the host scene
  that referenced it.

  That scene can intercept the message, act on it, transform it, and/or
  send it up to the host scene that references it. (Components can be
  nested many layers deep)

  To do this, the **host scene** should implement the `filter_event` callback.

  examples:

        def filter_event( {:click, :sample_button}, _, state ) do
          {:stop, state }
        end

        def filter_event( {:click, :sample_button}, _, state ) do
          {:continue, {:click, :transformed}, state }
        end

  Inside a filter_event callback you can modify a graph, change state,
  send messages, transform the event, stop the event, and much more.

  Add a button to a graph

  A button is a small scene that is pretty much just some text
  drawn over a rounded rectangle. The button scene contains logic to detect
  when the button is pressed, tracks it as the pointer moves around, and
  when it is released.

  Data:

      text

  * `text` must be a bitstring

  ### Messages

  If a button press is successful, it sends an event message to the host
  scene in the form of:

      {:click, id}

  ### Styles

  Buttons honor the following standard styles

  * `:hidden` - If `false` the component is rendered. If `true`, it is skipped. The default
    is `false`.
  * `:theme` - The color set used to draw. See below. The default is `:primary`

  ### Additional Styles

  Buttons honor the following list of additional styles.
  * `:width` - pass in a number to set the width of the button.
  * `:height` - pass in a number to set the height of the button.
  * `:radius` - pass in a number to set the radius of the button's rounded rectangle.
  * `:alignment` - set the aligment of the text inside the button. Can be one of
  `:left, :right, :center`. The default is `:center`.
  * `:button_font_size` - the size of the font in the button

  Buttons do not use the inherited `:font_size` style as the should look consistent regardless
  of what size the surrounding text is.

  ## Theme

  Buttons work well with the following predefined themes:
  `:primary`, `:secondary`, `:success`, `:danger`, `:warning`, `:info`, `:text`, `:light`, `:dark`

  To pass in a custom theme, supply a map with at least the following entries:

  * `:text` - the color of the text in the button
  * `:background` - the normal background of the button
  * `:active` - the background while the button is pressed

  ### Examples

  The following example creates a simple button and positions it on the screen.

      graph
      |> button( "Example", id: :button_id, translate: {20, 20} )

  The next example makes the same button as before, but colors it as a warning button. See
  the options list above for more details.

      graph
      |> button( "Example", id: :button_id, translate: {20, 20}, theme: :warning )
