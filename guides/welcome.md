# Scenic

Scenic is an application framework written directly on the Elixir/Erlang/OTP
stack. With it, you can build client-side applications that operate identically
across all supported operating systems, including MacOS, Ubuntu, Nerves/Linux,
and more.

Scenic is primarily aimed at fixed screen connected devices (IoT), but can also
be used to build portable applications.
